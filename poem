My colorful rainbow.
I do wish that you appear on my window every morning.
I really do.
You look colorful after rain.
You run across blue sky.
Oh look at that white unicorn.
It runs on the colorful rainbow.
Your colors make me feel so fine.
Your colors shine on the unicorn.
Its white turns to-
Purple indigo blue green yellow orange red.
This goes on and on.
